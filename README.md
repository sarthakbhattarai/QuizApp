# QuizApp
This project utilizes Django's admin interface to manage quiz types, questions, and choices efficiently. Admin users can create and organize quizzes, define correct answers, and track player performance. The frontend allows users to select a quiz, answer questions, and view their results, with progress managed via Django's session framework.
